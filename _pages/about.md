I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am working with Rajat Subhra Chakraborthy and part of the "Secured Embedded Architecture Lab" (SEAL) group. My research interests center on machine learning applications on hardware security problems. I'm also working on a project entitled "verification challenges for compression and crypto operations in Intel QAT hardware" sponsored by Intel, USA.

Before joining IIT Kharagpur, I worked as a firmware engineer in Horner Automation Group at Bangalore and also as Design Engineer at Processor Systems, Bangalore.
