## Profile

I am currently working as a Senior Embedded Security Researcher at the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Before this, I completed my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the Department of Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, under the supervision of Professor Rajat Subhra Chakraborty. My doctoral thesis focused on the design and analysis of machine learning-based model building attacks on physically unclonable functions. Prior to starting my Ph.D. at IIT Kharagpur, I worked as an embedded Linux developer for nearly six years in Bengaluru, India. At TII (Technology and Innovation Institute), my main work involves the design of a machine learning execution framework and exploration of TEE-based solutions.
