## Profile

I am currently working as a Senior Embedded Security Researcher at the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Before this, I completed my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the Department of Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, under the supervision of Professor Rajat Subhra Chakraborty. My doctoral thesis focused on the design and analysis of machine learning-based model building attacks on physically unclonable functions. Prior to starting my Ph.D. at IIT Kharagpur, I worked as an embedded Linux developer for nearly six years in Bengaluru, India. At TII (Technology and Innovation Institute), my main work involves the design of a machine learning execution framework and exploration of TEE-based solutions.

## Work Experience  

**Jan 2022 - Present** Senior Embedded Security Researcher
My responsibilities included:

- Proposed two LLM (Language Model) based research ideas to enhance existing tactical tools and methodologies. Provided LLM proposal links for reference here.
- Designed a tactical Machine Learning execution framework seamlessly integrated with existing tactical Android applications, enabling operational efficiency of ML applications.  
- Currently working on the development of a Gazing technique based continuous authentication to enhance security.

**Sep 2016 - Apr 2020** Senior Research Fellow (SRF).
I worked on the research project entitled “Verification Challenges in Compression and Cryptographic Stacks in Quick-Assist Technology,” which was sponsored by Intel USA. Under the supervision of Dr. Rajat Subhra Chakraborty, I was tasked with conducting an analysis of the data compression efficiency on Quick Assist Technology (QAT) hardware.

**Dec 2012 - Sep 2016** Firmware Engineer  
I was part of the firmware design and development team at Horner  Engineering Automation Group in Bengaluru, India.
